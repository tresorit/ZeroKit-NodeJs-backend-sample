# ZeroKit Node sample backend
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tresorit/ZeroKit-NodeJs-backend-sample.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tresorit/ZeroKit-NodeJs-backend-sample)
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/tresorit/ZeroKit-NodeJs-backend-sample/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/tresorit/ZeroKit-NodeJs-backend-sample?branch=master)

This is an example that can be used for reference when developing the backend service of your own ZeroKit using application.
It provides a fully functional REST api that is used by our other examples.

If you are using it with our examples, you only need to enter your configuration in config.json. It was designed with
reusability in mind, but there are some preparations to make if you want to use it in your own app.

This runs on Node.js > 6.0

## Configuration
Before you can start the server you should configure it by editing [config.json](./config.json). It's important to note,
that you will need IDP configured on your tenant as we recommend for all applications that need server side authorization.

You can see an example in [./config.example.json].

In config.json:
- dbUrl: The connection url of a mongo (you can use azure document db too), this will be used to store all data. 
See [below](#database) on how to get one for free.
- baseUrl: where your site will be hosted. This is used to check incoming requests for dns rebinding and to  calculate some callback urls for the idp code login (although this can be overwritten)
- appOrigins: the origins where the server should accept CORS calls (Web) from, basically where your client app is hosted
- zeroKit: This object contains all the ZeroKit related configurations
  - serviceUrl: The service url displayed on the management portal
  - adminKey: The either one of the admin keys that you can copy from the portal
  - sdkVersion: The version of the sdk your app uses. This is currently made for v4. 
  Please keep in mind, that this may need to be updated as well as your client code for different versions.
  - idp: List of IDP clients configured. More information will be provided in the documentation of the 
  example clients and [below](#server-side-authentication---idp).
    - clientId: The ID of the client 
    - clientSecret: The client secret of the client 
    - callbackURL: Where the IDP process redirects to, overriding the automatic calculation.
                    Required for hybrid flow (mobile) clients and optional for code flow (web) clients.

Please keep in mind, that many of these settings are used for strict, case-sensitive character matching, so they should be the same as on the management portal character-to-character.

If you want to use it with your own application you need to also modify app.js and customize the application logic
through the callbackConfig.

### Database
The example uses a [mongo database](mongodb.com) to store all the persisted data, so you have to enter a valid
mongodb url in the config file. You can use a locally hosted one, or 
you can get one for free from [mLab](https://mlab.com/). You'll only need a sandbox account. 

### Server side authentication - IDP
To make full use of the server you need to enable the Identity Provider on your tenant and configure a client for each
of your client applications.

You can enable the Identity Provider by clicking the switch next to the Identity Provider header. It is enabled if it
 turned blue.
#### Web
To add a client that will be used in a web app:
- Click Add client
- Enter the name of the client e.g.: Website
- Enter the url where you the client is allowed to be redirected below Redirect URLs. 
    
    In this example it will be something like: 
    - https://your-website.com/api/auth/callback
    - http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback
- Click Add next to the URL. The entered url should appear below the button.
- Repeat the 2 steps above to add all redirection urls (e.g.: both localhost and a remotely hosted url).

    I don't recommend using multiple redirect urls on the same client, 
    you should instead create a client each for each deployed backend. 
- Click Advanced options
- Choose the Authorization Code from the dropdown below Flow. It should be selected by default.
- Click Apply
- Now you need to add the client to the IDP portion of your config.json    
    See [above](#configuration) for details or see an example in [./config.example.json].
    
Please keep in mind, that all the settings will be used for strict, case-sensitive matching, so you should take care that the settings on the management portal and the settings in the config match character-to-character.

#### Mobile
To add a client that will be used in a mobile app:
- Click Add client
- Enter the name of the client e.g.: Mobile App 1
- Enter the following url below Redirect URLs:
    https://{client_id}.{tenant_id}.tresorit.io/
    Where:
    - {client_id} is the Id displayed below Client ID
    - {tenant_id} is the part of the Client ID before the _
    
    E.g.: https://tenant1234_client1234.tenant1234.tresorit.io
    
    (It's the client_id subdomain of your service url.)
- Click Add next to the URL. The entered url should appear below the button.
- Click Advanced options
- Choose the Hybrid from the dropdown below Flow.
- Click Apply
- Now you need to add the client to the IDP portion of your config.json    
    See [above](#configuration) for details or see an example in [./config.example.json].
    
Please keep in mind, that all the settings will be used for strict, case-sensitive matching, so you should take care that the settings on the management portal and the settings in the config match character-to-character.
## Running
You need to first install dependencies by ```npm install```

Then, if it's configured, you can run it simply by ```npm start``` 

This will start a server listening on port 3000, your application can make request to this, a full documentation is on it's way.   

### Environmental variables
Some of the applications behaviour can be controlled by environmental variables:
- ZKIT_CONFIG_FILE: if you want to use a different configuration file (i.e. for testing) you can set up a path relative to the project root here
- DEBUG: verbose logging can be controlled by setting this to different values, turning on all logging by "ZeroKit-backend-sample:*"
- PORT: defines the port the server is listening on (3000 by default)

## Testing
If you want to run the tests included in the application you will need to run ```npm test``` with a few environmental variables set:
- BROWSERSTACK_USERNAME: a browserstack username that can run the automated tests
- BROWSERSTACK_ACCESS_KEY: your access key on browserstack
